# Nivo Slider

The Nivo Slider is world renowned as the most beautiful and easy to use image slider on the market. There is literally no better way to make your website look totally stunning. But currently the development is stopped and [repository](https://github.com/Codeinwp/Nivo-Slider-jQuery) has been archived. So I had to made a fork to add support of `data-src` tag, which is required for some _lazy loading_ plugins to work, and fix support of `alt` tag. 
This is a project for my own needs, but I will certainly be glad if someone has a desire to improve or suggest something.
